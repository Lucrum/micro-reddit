# micro-reddit

This is a project from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-micro-reddit#project-micro-reddit).

This is a barebones Rails app which contains models for users, posts, and comments. There is no front end.

To interact with it, run `rails console` in the root directory.
